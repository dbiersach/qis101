# QIS101 Python and Jupyter Notebook Style Guide

These instructions define the expected coding and documentation style for all Python scripts (`.py`) and Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) in this repository.

The goal is clarity, consistency, and strong pedagogical value.

---

## General Principles

- Code should be **clear, explicit, and readable**.
- Prefer **teaching-oriented explanations** over compact or clever code.
- Write as if the reader is a **student learning the concept for the first time**.
- Avoid unnecessary abstraction unless it improves understanding.

---

## File Naming

- Use lowercase `snake_case` for all files.
- File names should be **descriptive and topic-based**.

Examples:

- `basel_series.ipynb`
- `quantum_circuit_intro.ipynb`
- `qis101_utils.py`

---

## Jupyter Notebook Structure

### First Code Cell

The first code cell must begin with a short docstring containing the notebook filename:

```python
"""example_notebook.ipynb"""
```

---

### Cell Labeling

Each code cell should be labeled with a structured comment:

```python
# Cell 01 - Import packages
# Cell 02 - Define helper functions
# Cell 03 - Run simulation
```

Guidelines:

- Use two-digit numbering (`01`, `02`, etc.)
- Keep descriptions short and meaningful

---

### Markdown Cell Structure

Every markdown cell after the first one in a notebook must begin with a
horizontal rule on its own line, followed by a `###` header:

```markdown
---
### Setup: simulation parameters

The simulation runs from ...
```

The rule draws a visible line between the cell and the output of the code cell
above it, which otherwise run together in the notebook view.

Header rules:

- Start at `###`. Never use `#` or `##`, which render so large that a short
  heading eats a disproportionate amount of vertical space.
- `###` is the only level used for section headers. Sub-points inside a section
  are made with bold lead-ins or lists, not `####`.
- The very first cell of the notebook is the only exception to the rule: it
  opens directly with its `###` title, since there is no output above it to
  separate.
- A markdown cell that follows another markdown cell still takes the rule. The
  separator doubles as a section break, so it stays even where there is no code
  output above it.

Do not open a markdown cell with a bolded run-in sentence such as
`**Simulation parameters.**`. Write a real `###` header instead.

---

### Every Code Cell Must Display Output

Never write a code cell that produces no visible output. A cell containing
only imports, constants, or function definitions gives the student no feedback
that they ran it. It is easy to skip a silent cell and then hit a `NameError`
in the next one.

When a cell exists mainly to define things, end it with a short check that
exercises what was just defined. Call the new functions on a simple case and
`print()` or `display()` the result next to the expected answer:

```python
# Quick check that circuit works as expected
out = circuit(t, t, t, t)
print(f"circuit(1, 1, 1, 1) = {out[1, 0]}  (expected 0)")
```

This doubles as a worked example and as proof the cell ran.

Stale saved output is the related hazard. A cell whose code was edited but
never rerun still shows its old result, which reads as if it passed. Rerun
the notebook after editing it.

---

### Markdown + Code Balance

- Use markdown cells to explain:
  - What the code does
  - Why the method is used
  - What the results mean
- Keep explanations **plain, direct, and instructional**
- Avoid overly formal or verbose writing

---

## Python Code Style

### Type Hints

- Use type hints for all reusable functions and classes
- Prefer modern Python 3.13 syntax:

```python
float | np.ndarray
list[str]
tuple[np.ndarray, ...]
```

---

### Docstrings

- Use **NumPy-style docstrings** for reusable functions in `.py` files

Example:

```python
def compute_energy(x: np.ndarray) -> float:
    """
    Compute the total energy of the system.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : np.ndarray
        Input state vector.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        Computed energy value.
    """
```

- Short helper functions may use one-line docstrings:

```python
def square(x: float) -> float:
    """Return x squared."""
```

---

## Imports

Use standard aliases:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

---

## Comments and Writing Style

- Comments must be **functional and explanatory**
- Focus on:
  - Purpose of the code
  - Mathematical meaning
  - Instructions to the reader/student

### Avoid

- Decorative or stylistic comments
- Redundant comments that restate obvious code
- Em dashes or long dashes

Instead:

- Use normal hyphens `-`
- Or rewrite the sentence for clarity

---

## Notebook Teaching Style

When writing notebooks:

- Break work into logical steps
- Explain transitions between steps
- Clearly interpret results

Good pattern:

1. Introduce concept
2. Show implementation
3. Run code
4. Interpret output

---

## Environment Notes

These are properties of the development machine, not style rules.

### Force the inline matplotlib backend in notebooks

The venv's default backend is `qtagg`, because PySide6 is installed so that
standalone `.py` scripts can open an interactive plot window. That default is
wrong inside a Jupyter kernel: `plt.show()` opens a Qt window that blocks the
kernel, and the cell never returns.

Two layers guard against this, and both should stay in place:

- Every notebook that imports matplotlib puts `%matplotlib inline` in its
  first code cell, right after the docstring and cell-label comment. This
  travels with the `.ipynb` file, so it works for students on any machine.
- The workspace file sets `"jupyter.runStartupCommands": ["%matplotlib inline"]`
  as a backstop for kernels started outside a notebook that carries the magic.

Standalone scripts are unaffected and keep their interactive Qt window. A
notebook that genuinely needs a live animation uses `%matplotlib widget`
instead, never the Qt backend.

## Reference Material Loaded On Demand

Two longer references used to live in this file. They are now skills under
`.claude/skills/`, so Claude Code loads them only when the task calls for
them instead of on every session. Other tools should read the files directly.

- `.claude/skills/office-latex/SKILL.md` - Office-compatible LaTeX for the
  Microsoft 365 Equation Editor (PowerPoint and Word), including Dirac
  bra-ket notation.
- `.claude/skills/machine-environment-notes/SKILL.md` - diagnosing a notebook
  cell that hangs or never finishes, clearing orphaned kernel processes,
  reloading VS Code after a `uv sync`, and why quantum chemistry packages
  cannot be installed on this machine.
